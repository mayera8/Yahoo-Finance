Add a new folder called Output

Change file paths to your own

Use the .py file called missed day if you miss a day or on Monday (Since the markets are closed on the weekend).

The output displays the symbol, adjusted close, and percent change for a number of stocks. All of this is pulled from Yahoo! Finance
